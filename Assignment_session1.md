Definations:

1. Convolution:The process of placing a filter on top of the an input and as a result the filter identifies and only lets specific features pass

2. Filters/Kernels: N X N matrix whose purpose is to extract specific characterstics from an image

3. Epochs: The traversal of the model over the complete dataset is known as an ephoc

4. 1x1 Convolution: The process of multiplying the input image with a 1 X 1 sized filter

5. 3x3 Convolution: The process of multiplying the input image with a 3 X 3 sized filter

6. Feature Map:The container of a feature extractor that contains all possible information to extract a specific feature

7. Activation Function: A mathematical function that defines the minimum threshold at which a filter would consider a particular feature

8. Receptive Field: Span of the input size, a particular feature map is representing or looking at
